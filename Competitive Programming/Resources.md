**Competitive Programming**

Competitive Programming or CP refers to the solving of complex algorithmic problems as a sport. It is often seen as a rather difficult activity, and many CS student stay vary of it. But at the same time, a good competitive programmer can often crack the toughest of technical interviews with minimal efforts. 

Here I provide some of the most popular websites and learning resources that I have found the most useful in my CP journey, using which you can enhance you CP skills (Remember - consistency is the key)
